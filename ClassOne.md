## Class-1 - Introduction to Python and Setting Up the Environment

In this lesson we have a brief introduction to Python and how to configure the environment to start programming.

####Case do you use linux just open the terminal and type:

#####python 2.x.x:
```bash
$: python 

Python 2.7.12 (default, Nov 19 2016, 06:48:10) 
[GCC 5.4.0 20160609] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 
```
#####python 3.x.x:
```bash
$: python3 

Python 3.5.2 (default, Nov 17 2016, 17:05:23) 
[GCC 5.4.0 20160609] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 
```

####Case do you need **Python** with a different OS?

Make downnload the latest source release Python for: 
- [Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
- [Mac OS X](https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/)
- [Other](https://www.python.org/download/other/).


####Do you perfer use IDE or TextEditor?

So... if you like use IDE, do you can use the [PyCharm Python IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm). 
The PyCharm have two versions: 
- **Community**: Lightweight IDE for Python & Scientific development 
- **Professional**: Full-featured IDE for Python & Web development 

That is, free version and pay version. More in... [https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/)

Now if you prefer an code editor, do you can use someone of your preference as: 
- [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com)
- [Gedit](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit) 
- [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)

Defining your development environment let's go to our first code...

####Hello World Python?

For the Hello World Python example I will go to use the Sublime.
Open your Sublime and create an folder named **PythonBasic** in some directory of your preference, in my case I used the directory **/Desktop**. 
After that, create another folder inside PythonBasic called **class1**, look at image below:

![/home/robsonfagundes/Desktop/PythonBasic/class1](https://github.com/robsonfagundes/basic-python-course/blob/master/images/class1-b.png "PythonBasic directory (/home/robsonfagundes/Desktop/PythonBasic/class)")
I defined this folder structure to make our code more organized.

Ok let's to the code:

Create an new file named **hellopython.py** in directory class1, and put the follow code:
```python 

print('Hello World Python');
 
```
