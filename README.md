================
The basic python course is based in https://solyd.com.br/treinamentos/python-basico course. 

Python is a programming language that lets you work more quickly and integrate your systems more effectively.
Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Pythonâ€™s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.
Some of the Language Features:
----------------
- Does not require you to declare variables, but requires you to initialize them
- Strong dynamic typing, requires explicit conversions
- Supports operator overload and multiple inheritance (something not found in Java)
- Uses exceptions, but it does not force you to declare or treat (all libraries work with exceptions, which gives great comfort to the programmer, because when calling a function, you know you can trust the result of it)
- Uses namespaces, modules and packages (which allow the construction of many large programs)

About this course:
----------------
The basic Python course is a course of the Python programming language and programming logic for beginners, ideal for anyone who has never programmed or is willing to migrate to the Python language.
